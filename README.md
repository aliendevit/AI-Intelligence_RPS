# AI-Intelligence_RPS
# You play Rock–Paper–Scissors against your computer using your hand in front of your camera.

# The app uses your webcam to detect your hand and classify your gesture (rock, paper, or scissors) using a deep learning model.

# It also detects and recognizes your face, so it can remember your identity and track your playing style.

# The AI opponent gets smarter the more you play. It uses reinforcement learning to remember your previous moves and adapts its strategy to try and beat you!

# If a recognized user comes back later, the AI can "remember" how that person played before and can adjust its strategy accordingly.

# The app also supports multiple users with face recognition, giving each their own experience.

# It features a modern UI overlay, including headers/footers, game stats, and dynamic AI mode selection.
